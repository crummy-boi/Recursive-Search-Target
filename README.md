This program has two parts regarding recusion.   
Part one tracks and finds a target file called "longwords.txt" in a directory using recursion.  
Part two tracks, compares, and finds a word target in a file called "longwords.txt" using the behaviours of a binary search and recursive search.  

This was an assignment for my CSS 143 class.
