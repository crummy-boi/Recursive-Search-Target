# Recursive Search Target

This program has two parts regarding recusion.   
Part one tracks and finds a target file called "longwords.txt" in a directory path using recursion.  
Part two tracks, compares, and finds a word target in a file called "longwords.txt" using the behaviours of a binary search and recursive search.  

Note: Since I used a MacBook Pro, the directory path is based on Mac's pathway, not Windows or Linux.

This was an assignment for my CSS 143 class.
